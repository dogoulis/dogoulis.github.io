I work as a PhD Researcher at SnT - the Interdisciplinary Research Centre on Security and Trust (SnT) of the University of Luxembourg. My research activities are currently focused on Physics Informed Machine Learning (PIML) with both theoretical and practical applications (powerflow estimation in complex powergrids).
