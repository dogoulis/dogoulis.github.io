Hi there!

I work as a PhD Researcher at SnT - the Interdisciplinary Research Centre on Security and Trust (SnT) of the University of Luxembourg. My research activities are currently focused on Physics Informed Machine Learning (PIML) and constrained learning. The main application of my research lies in complex energy systems and power grids.
