Hi there!

I work as a PhD Researcher at SnT - the Interdisciplinary Research Centre on Security and Trust (SnT) of the University of Luxembourg under the supervision of [Maxime Cordy](https://maxcordy.github.io/). My research activities are currently focused on Physics Informed Machine Learning (PIML) and constrained learning. The main application of my research lies in complex energy systems and power grids.

Prior to this role I was working as a Research Associate at [ITI (Information Technology Institute)](https://www.iti.gr/iti/en/home/) of  [CERTH (Centre for Research & Technology, Hellas)](https://www.certh.gr/root.en.aspx), with a main focus on deep fake and generated images detection, under the supervision of [Symeon Papadopoulos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GuhyORoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [George Kordopatis](https://gkordo.github.io/). I have also contributed to projects in bioinformatics.

Apart from that I hold the Diploma on Classical Guitar and Classical Music, obtained in the National Conservatory of Thessaloniki, under the tutorship of [Costas Cotsiolis](https://www.daddario.com/artists/guitar/costas_cotsiolis/?srsltid=AfmBOooVWV_VF5QyFPKmctZiTnGphvOAmQDfZll1CG5gQWmTWC-xaY-8). I have participated and have won prizes in International Guitar Competitions and had masterclasses with many top-tier musicians, including A. Desiderio, Z. Dukic, R. Aussel, L. Brouwer. On Bach vs Beethoven vs Mozart, I will always go with Mozart.
